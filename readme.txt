You can create your own style by modifying the file *local.beans.css*. This file is located at
*woocommerce-beans/assets/css/local.beans.css*. If *local.beans.css* does not exist,
you should create it by copying *master.beans.css*: *woocommerce-beans/assets/css/master.beans.css*

- Get the .pot file located at languages/woocommerce-beans.pot in the Beans plugin directory.
- Create the .mo using your preferred [translation Tool](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/).
- Put your custom Beans translations in your WordPress language directory,
located at: WP_LANG_DIR . "/plugins/woocommerce-beans-{$locale}.mo".
For example: /wp-content/languages/plugins/woocommerce-beans-af_ZA.mo
for Afrikaans - South Africa translation.

Help us translate Beans. Send us your .po and .mo files and they will be integrated in the next update.
