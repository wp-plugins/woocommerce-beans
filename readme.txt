== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much does Beans cost? =

Beans is free to use for as long as you want and with an unlimited number of customers.
But if you want to take full advantage of Beans
and customize it with your branding you can try one of our [premium package](http://bit.ly/1Eb0dF1).

= How can you modify the style? =

You can create your own style by modifying the file *local.beans.css*. This file is located at
*woocommerce-beans/assets/css/local.beans.css*. If *local.beans.css* does not exist,
you should create it by copying *master.beans.css*: *woocommerce-beans/assets/css/master.beans.css*

= How can you change Beans plugin language? =

- Get the .pot file located at languages/woocommerce-beans.pot in the Beans plugin directory.
- Create the .mo using your preferred [translation Tool](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/).
- Put your custom Beans translations in your WordPress language directory,
located at: WP_LANG_DIR . "/woocommerce-beans/{$text_domain}-{$locale}.mo".
The main text domain is **woocommerce-beans** and the admin text domain is **woocommerce-beans-admin**.
For example: /wp-content/languages/woocommerce-beans/woocommerce-beans-af_ZA.mo
for Afrikaans - South Africa translation of the main text domain.
