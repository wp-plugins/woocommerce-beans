Beans helps you promote your business through your loyalty and reward program.

== Description ==

Beans is a powerful loyalty & reward program that helps you engage your users and promote your business.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuSXqzha4A4

Beans is a credit base system that allows you to reward your users:

- When they subscribe to your reward Program.
- When they like your Facebook page.
- When they follow you on Twitter (beta).
- When they refer you to a friend (beta).
- When they make a purchase.
- and more to come...

When you create a reward program with Beans it will be promoted on Beans Platform (Screenshot 5)
and indexed on Search Engine (Google, Bing, Yahoo Search...).

Your beans page (like your Facebook page, Twitter page or PInterest page) 
becomes a showcase for your business to drive new sales and increase your digital footprint.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can you modify the style? =
You can create your own style by modifying the file *local.beans.css*. This file is located at
*woocommerce-beans/assets/css/local.beans.css*. If *local.beans.css* does not exist, 
you should create it by copying *master.beans.css*: *woocommerce-beans/assets/css/master.beans.css*

= How can you change Beans plugin language? =
You can translate the plugin in your language easily by using the .po file in 'languages' Beans directory.

- Copy and rename the woocommerce-beans-xx_XX.po (for example for french the renamed file would be woocommerce-beans-fr_FR.po)
- Change the "Language: xx_XX\n" line in the file according to your language (for example for french it would be "Language: fr_FR\n")

Now you can translate the plugin using for example Poedit.
Just open the file with Poedit and start translation.
