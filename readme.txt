Beans is a credit base system that allows you to reward your users:

- When they subscribe to your reward Program.
- When they like your Facebook page.
- When they follow you on Twitter (beta).
- When they refer you to a friend (beta).
- When they make a purchase.
- and more to come...

When you create a reward program with Beans it will be promoted on Beans Platform (Screenshot 5)
and indexed on Search Engine (Google, Bing, Yahoo Search...).

Your beans page (like your Facebook page, Twitter page or PInterest page) 
becomes a showcase for your business to drive new sales and increase your digital footprint.
